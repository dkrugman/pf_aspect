# Parallel Image Processing

Image processing now runs **in parallel** with photo downloads, dramatically reducing total import time.

## How It Works

**Before**: Download all photos → Wait → Process all photos (sequential)  
**After**: Download photos + Process photos simultaneously (parallel)

### Process Flow
1. **File downloads** in batches with throttling
2. **Each completed download** immediately starts image processing  
3. **Downloads continue** while processing runs in background
4. **All tasks complete** before import process finishes

## Performance Impact

**Example**: 100 photos, 5 min download + 10 min processing

- **Sequential**: 5 + 10 = **15 minutes total**
- **Parallel**: max(5, 10) = **10 minutes total**  
- **Result**: **33% faster** imports

## New Methods

### `_start_image_processing_async(file_path)`
Creates background task for immediate processing

### `_process_single_image_async(file_path)`  
Processes individual images asynchronously

### `_wait_for_image_processing_completion()`
Waits for all processing tasks to finish

### `get_image_processing_status()`
Returns current task status for monitoring

## Monitoring

```python
# Check progress
status = import_photos.get_image_processing_status()
print(f"Processing: {status['running']}/{status['total']} tasks")

# Wait for completion
await import_photos._wait_for_image_processing_completion()
```

## Configuration

Respects existing throttling settings:
```yaml
aspect:
  max_concurrent_downloads: 3      # Download concurrency
  max_concurrent_db_operations: 1  # Database operations  
  download_batch_size: 5           # Batch size
```

## Benefits

✅ **Faster imports** - Parallel execution  
✅ **Better resource usage** - CPU and I/O overlap  
✅ **Real-time progress** - Immediate feedback  
✅ **Maintains stability** - Respects throttling limits  
✅ **Easy monitoring** - Built-in status tracking  

## Log Messages

```
Started image processing for DSC_001.jpg
Completed image processing for DSC_001.jpg  
Waiting for 15 image processing tasks to complete...
Image processing completed: 15 successful, 0 failed
```

The system now provides true parallel processing - downloads and image processing happen simultaneously, dramatically reducing import time while maintaining system stability.
